Getting Started

New to Ocean? The following sections describe how to install Ocean tools, what they are
and how they fit together, and give examples of using them to solve hard problems
on a D-Wave quantum computer.

Initial Set Up
==============

The following steps set up your development environment for Ocean:

    overview/leap_auth
    overview/sapi

1.  :ref:`install`

    Installation is **not needed** if you are using an IDE that implements the 
    `Development Containers specification <https://containers.dev/supporting>`_
    (aka "devcontainers"), whether locally on your system (e.g., VS Code) or 
    cloud-based (e.g., `GitHub Codespaces <https://docs.github.com/codespaces>`_), 
    because you can work in an updated Ocean environment through the 
    `Ocean Docker file <https://hub.docker.com/r/dwavesys/ocean-dev>`_. 

2.  :ref:`leap_auth`

    Optionally authorize Ocean to access your Leap account to facilitate  
    token management.

3.  :ref:`sapi_access`

    Enable the running problems on D-Wave remote compute resources, including 
    quantum-classical hybrid solvers and the D-Wave quantum processing unit (QPU).

Ocean's Programming Model

D-Wave Compute Resources
========================

Use Ocean's :term:`sampler`\ s to solve problems on D-Wave's compute resources (:term:`solver`\ s)
or locally on your CPU.

    overview/hybrid
    overview/cpu
    overview/qpu

Because most industrial problems (large, complex, and hard) are best approached 
with quantum-classical hybrid solvers, a good place to start is with examples of 
the :ref:`examples_hybrid` section. If you wish to learn how to work directly with 
the quantum computer, see the examples of the :ref:`examples_qpu` section.

End-to-End Examples: Hybrid 
===========================

For beginners, formulating problems as `Quadratic Models`_ can be a more 
intuitive introduction to solving optimization problems. `Nonlinear Models`_ 
may be more familiar for users with experience in non-linear programming; for 
many problems, these models---if effectively formulated---are expected to 
enable superior performance.

Additional Examples
===================

D-Wave's `dwave-examples <https://github.com/dwave-examples>`_ GitHub repo
contains many more code examples:

*   Demos

    Typically in the form of short code examples you can open in
    a supported cloud-based IDE or copy (clone) locally and run. For example:

    *   `Nurse scheduling <https://github.com/dwave-examples/nurse-scheduling>`_,
        `maze <https://github.com/dwave-examples/maze>`_,
        `circuit fault diagnosis <https://github.com/dwave-examples/circuit-fault-diagnosis>`_,
        and others provide examples of constraint-satisfaction problems.

    *   `Map coloring <https://github.com/dwave-examples/map-coloring>`_,
        `job-shop scheduling <https://github.com/dwave-examples/job-shop-scheduling-cqm>`_,
        and others can complement similar examples presented here.

    *   `RNA folding <https://github.com/dwave-examples/rna-folding>`_,
        `portfolio optimization <https://github.com/dwave-examples/portfolio-optimization>`_,
        and others provide prototype applications in a variety of industries.

*   Jupyter Notebooks

    These examples, in a web-based interactive environment that includes documentation
    and code, are helpful for both walking beginners through the theory and practice
    of problem solving and explaining complex features. They can also serve as
    a framework in which to develop your own code. For example:

    *   `Structural imbalance notebook <https://github.com/dwave-examples/structural-imbalance-notebook>`_
        can complement the :ref:`hss` example.
    *   `Hybrid computing notebooks <https://github.com/dwave-examples/hybrid-computing-notebook>`_
        walk you through using and developing hybrid solvers.
    *   `Pegasus notebook <https://github.com/dwave-examples/pegasus-notebook>`_,
        `reverse annealing notebook <https://github.com/dwave-examples/reverse-annealing-notebook>`_,
        and others explain features of the quantum computer.
