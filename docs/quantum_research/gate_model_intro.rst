===================
What is Gate Model?
===================

Gate-model quantum computing, also known as circuit model, implements compute
algorithms with
`quantum gates <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_logic_gate>`_, analogously
to the use of `Boolean gates <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic_gate>`_ in
classical computers.

:ref:`Ocean software <index_ocean_sdk>` provides the
:ref:`dwave-gate <index_gate>` package for constructing, modifying and running
quantum circuits on a simulator.
