        Despite the incredible power of today's supercomputers, many complex
        computing problems cannot be addressed by conventional systems. The huge
        growth of data and our need to better understand everything from the
        universe to our own DNA leads us to seek new tools that can help provide
        answers. Quantum computing is the next frontier in computing, providing
        an entirely new approach to solving the world's most difficult problems.

        While certainly not easy, much progress has been made in the field of
        quantum computing since 1981, when Feynman gave his famous lecture at
        the California Institute of Technology. Still a relatively young field,
        quantum computing is complex and different approaches are being pursued
        around the world. Today, there are two leading candidate architectures
        for quantum computers: gate model (also known as circuit model) and
        quantum annealing.

        `Gate-model quantum computing <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_circuit>`_
        implements compute algorithms with quantum gates, analogously to the use
        of Boolean gates in classical computers.

        With quantum annealers you initialize the system in a low-energy state
        and gradually introduce the parameters of a problem you wish to solve.
        The slow change makes it likely that the system ends in a low-energy
        state of the problem, which corresponds to an optimal solution. This
        technique is explained in more detail in the :ref:`getting_started_qa`
        chapter.

        Quantum annealing is implemented in |dwave_short|'s generally available
        quantum computers, such as the |dwave_5kq_tm| system, as a single
        quantum algorithm, and this scalable approach to quantum computing has
        enabled us to create quantum processing units (QPUs) with more than 5000
        quantum bits (*qubits*)---far beyond the state of the art for gate-model
        quantum computing.

        |dwave_short| has been developing various generations of our "machine of
        a different kind," to use Feynman's words, since 1999. We are the
        world's first commercial quantum computer company.

    ..  tab-item:: D-Wave's QPUs
        :name: tab_quantum_computers

        The |dwave_short| system contains a QPU that must be kept at a
        temperature near absolute zero and isolated from the surrounding
        environment in order to behave quantum mechanically. The system achieves
        these requirements as follows:

        *   Cryogenic temperatures, achieved using a closed-loop cryogenic
            dilution refrigerator system. The QPU operates at temperatures below
            20 mK.
        *   Shielding from electromagnetic interference, achieved using a radio
            frequency (RF)â€“shielded enclosure and a magnetic shielding
            subsystem.

            :width: 400 pt

            |dwave_5kq| system.

        The |dwave_short| QPU (:numref:`Figure %s <qpu1>`) is a lattice of tiny
        metal loops, each of which is a qubit or a coupler. Below temperatures
        of 9.2 kelvin, these loops become superconductors and exhibit
        quantum-mechanical effects.

        The QPU in |dwave_short|'s |dwave_5kq| system has more than 5,000 qubits
        and 35,000 couplers. To reach this scale, it uses over |max_j_junctions|
        Josephson junctions, which makes the |dwave_5kq| QPU by far the most
        complex superconducting integrated circuit ever built.

        For details on the topology of the QPU, see the
        :ref:`getting_started_topologies` section.

        .. note::
            For more details on the physical system, including specifications
            and essential safety information required for anyone who accesses
            the hardware directly, see the |doc_operations| manual, available
            from |dwave_short|.

    .. tab-item:: Software Environment
        :name: tab_dwave_software_environment

        Users interact with the |dwave_short| quantum computer through a web
        user interface (UI), and through open-source tools that communicate with
        the Solver API (SAPI).\ [#]_
        The SAPI components are responsible for user interaction, user
        authentication, and work scheduling. In turn, SAPI connects to back-end
        servers that send problems to and return results from QPUs and
        additional solvers, which are located in different geographical regions
        (for example, North America or Europe).\ [#]_

        See :numref:`Figure %s <network-gs>` for a simplified view of the
        |dwave_short| software environment.

        .. [#]
            A *solver* is simply a resource that runs a problem.
            Some solvers interface to the QPU; others leverage CPU and GPU
            resources.

        .. [#]
            Solvers are available by region.
            To view the supported regions and solvers that are available in each
            one, go to your dashboard in the
