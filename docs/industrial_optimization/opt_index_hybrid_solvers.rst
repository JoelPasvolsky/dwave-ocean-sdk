The |cloud_tm| service provides these :term:`hybrid` :term:`solver`\ s.

Nonlinear Solver
================

`Nonlinear programming (NLP) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_programming>`_ 
is the process of solving an optimization problem where some of the constraints 
are not linear equalities and/or the objective function is not a linear function. 
Such optimization problems are pervasive in business and logistics: inventory 
management, scheduling employees, equipment delivery, and many more.

Large optimization problems can be formulated as 
:ref:`nonlinear models <concept_models_nonlinear>`, as described 
in the :ref:`opt_model_construction_nl` section. You can then use 
the nonlinear hybrid :term:`solver` hosted in the |cloud_tm| service 
to find good solutions.

CQM Solver 
===========

Large optimization problems can be formulated as 
:ref:`constrained quadratic models <concept_models_cqm>`, as described 
in the :ref:`opt_model_construction_qm` section. You can then use 
the CQM hybrid :term:`solver` hosted in the |cloud_tm| service 
to find good solutions.
