For beginners, formulating problems as `Quadratic Models`_ can be a more
intuitive introduction to solving optimization problems. `Nonlinear Models`_
may be more familiar for users with experience in non-linear programming; for
many problems, these models---if effectively formulated---are expected to enable
superior performance.

Nonlinear Models
================

These examples solve small instances of known optimization problems using
the `Leap <https://cloud.dwavesys.com/leap/>`_ service's hybrid
:term:`nonlinear-model <nonlinear model>` solver.

        Helps you start using the Leap service's hybrid nonlinear-model solver.

Quadratic Models
================

These examples use the |cloud| service's :term:`quadratic model` solvers.

        Solves a constrained problem with binary variables using the
        |cloud| service's CQM solver.

        :link-type: ref

        Solves an constrained problem with integer variables using the Leap
        service's CQM solver.

    .. grid-item-card:: :ref:`opt_example_cqm_diet`
        :link: opt_example_cqm_diet
        :link-type: ref

        Solves a mixed-integer linear-programming (MILP) problem
        using the Leap service's CQM solver.
