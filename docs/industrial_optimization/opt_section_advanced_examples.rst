*   :ref:`opt_example_bqm_structuralimbalance` solves an unconstrained problem using a
    Leap hybrid :term:`BQM` solver.
*   :ref:`opt_example_kerberos_map` demonstrates using an out-of-the-box Ocean hybrid solver.
*   :ref:`opt_example_dqm_map` solves a discrete quadratic model (:term:`DQM`) using a
    Leap hybrid DQM solver.
*   :ref:`opt_example_dwavehybrid_manyvariables` builds a hybrid workflow and solver for a large graph problem.

Additional Examples
===================

D-Wave's `dwave-examples <https://github.com/dwave-examples>`_ GitHub repo
contains many more code examples:

*   Demos

    Typically in the form of short code examples you can open in
    a supported cloud-based IDE or copy (clone) locally and run. For example:

    *   `Nurse scheduling <https://github.com/dwave-examples/nurse-scheduling>`_,
        `maze <https://github.com/dwave-examples/maze>`_,
        `circuit fault diagnosis <https://github.com/dwave-examples/circuit-fault-diagnosis>`_,
        and others provide examples of constraint-satisfaction problems.

    *   `Map coloring <https://github.com/dwave-examples/map-coloring>`_,
        `job-shop scheduling <https://github.com/dwave-examples/job-shop-scheduling-cqm>`_,
        and others can complement similar examples presented here.

    *   `RNA folding <https://github.com/dwave-examples/rna-folding>`_,
        `portfolio optimization <https://github.com/dwave-examples/portfolio-optimization>`_,
        and others provide prototype applications in a variety of industries.

*   Jupyter Notebooks

    These examples, in a web-based interactive environment that includes documentation
    and code, are helpful for both walking beginners through the theory and practice
    of problem solving and explaining complex features. They can also serve as
    a framework in which to develop your own code. For example:

    *   `Structural imbalance notebook <https://github.com/dwave-examples/structural-imbalance-notebook>`_
        can complement the :ref:`hss` example.
    *   `Hybrid computing notebooks <https://github.com/dwave-examples/hybrid-computing-notebook>`_
        walk you through using and developing hybrid solvers.
    *   `Pegasus notebook <https://github.com/dwave-examples/pegasus-notebook>`_,
        `reverse annealing notebook <https://github.com/dwave-examples/reverse-annealing-notebook>`_,
        and others explain features of the quantum computer.
