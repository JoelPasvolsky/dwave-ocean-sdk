For beginners, formulating problems as `Quadratic Models`_ can be a more
intuitive introduction to solving optimization problems. `Nonlinear Models`_
may be more familiar for users with experience in non-linear programming; for
many problems, these models---if effectively formulated---are expected to enable
superior performance.

Quadratic Models
================

.. grid:: 3
    :gutter: 2

    .. grid-item-card:: :ref:`opt_example_cqm_binpacking`

        Solves a constrained problem with binary variables using the
        `Leap <https://cloud.dwavesys.com/leap/>`_ service's :term:`CQM` solver.

    .. grid-item-card:: :ref:`opt_example_cqm_stockselling`

        Solves an constrained problem with integer variables using the Leap
        service's CQM solver.

    .. grid-item-card:: :ref:`opt_example_cqm_diet`

        Solves a mixed-integer linear-programming
        (`MILP <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_programming>`_) problem
        using the Leap service's CQM solver.

Nonlinear Models
================

These examples solve small instances of known optimization problems using
the `Leap <https://cloud.dwavesys.com/leap/>`_ service's hybrid
:term:`nonlinear-model <nonlinear model>` solver.

.. grid:: 3
    :gutter: 2

    .. grid-item-card:: :ref:`opt_example_nl_tsp`

        Helps you start using the Leap service's hybrid nonlinear-model solver.

    .. grid-item-card:: :ref:`opt_example_nl_cvrp`

        Demonstrates more advanced usage options for solving nonlinear models.
