About the Service

The Leap service hosts |dwave_short|'s :term:`solvers <solver>`, including
quantum computers and :term:`hybrid` solvers. It enables you to do the
following:

*   Submit problems and view results and usage statistics
*   Administer projects
*   Find learning resources: a `Community page <https://support.dwavesys.com/>`_
    where you can pose questions and provide answers to other users,
    a `Resources page <https://cloud.dwavesys.com/leap/resources/demos/>`_ with
    interactive demos and a searchable collection of examples, and a
    `Help Center <https://support.dwavesys.com/>`_ for frequently asked
    questions (FAQ) section and a searchable knowledge base

Sign up for the Leap service here: https://cloud.dwavesys.com/leap.

Dashboard
---------

The dashboard is the home for your experience using the Leap service and
contains the following information, some of which you can also update; for
example:

*   Your account settings and a summary of your account
*   Your active project and its associated API token
*   Status of problems you have submitted and usage statistics
*   Solver status

You might be a member of multiple projects, but the information displayed on the
dashboard is only for the active project; for example, the solvers that have
been assigned to the active project. You can make a different project active by
selecting *your_user_name* > **Projects** > *project*.

The Leap service supports solvers in multiple regions (for example, North
America and Europe). The dashboard displays the solvers that are available by
region.

Solver Access
=============

Your customer plan\ [#]_ and :ref:`seat type <admin_def_seat_type>` in a
project, together with your customer contract (where applicable), determine your
degree of access to solvers; for example, you may not have access to all solvers
that are available in the Leap service. You can view your solver access and
usage for a project on the dashboard.

Users with :ref:`limited solver access <admin_def_solver_access_limit>` can
submit problems to the solvers in a project while their remaining solver-access
time\ [#]_ for that project is sufficient.

.. [#] For information about customer plans, see the
    `Leap Customer Plans <https://cloud.dwavesys.com/leap/plans>`_ page.

.. [#] A user's solver-access time for a project is renewed monthly, subject to
    the customer contract; the renewal date is displayed on the dashboard.

API Tokens
----------

To submit a problem, an API token is required. Instead of a user name and
password, an API token is used to authenticate your client session when it
connects to the Leap service. A unique and secure API token is generated
for each of your projects, excluding those with the **Trial Plan** account
type,\ [#]_ and is available on the dashboard. If your API token is shared or
compromised in any way, reset it via the dashboard.

.. [#]  Projects with the **Trial Plan** account type do not include the use of
    API tokens required to submit arbitrary problems to solvers and thus users
    in those projects can only run certain demos.

Ocean SDK Access
================

You can authorize Ocean software to access your account in the Leap service and
store your API token in your development environment; see the
:ref:`ocean_leap_authorization` section for details.

(For information on configuring Ocean software to access preferred solvers or
use one of multiple API tokens, see the :ref:`ocean_index_get_started` page.)

Problem Storage
===============

Up to 1000 of your most recent problems are stored and accessible in the Leap
service for up to 365 days; if the number of your problems exceeds 1000, the
Leap service begins to delete the oldest ones.

.. _deprecated_features:

Feature Deprecation
===================

A Leap service feature may be deprecated and, during the deprecation period,
information about such a deprecation is displayed whenever the feature is used.
For example, a message would be displayed when a deprecated SAPI endpoint is
called. For the Ocean SDK, deprecation messages are displayed in a terminal; for
SAPI, deprecation messages are displayed as HTTP ``X-Deprecation`` response
headers. A deprecation message includes the following:

*   Brief description

*   Deprecation ID, which can be used to find a more detailed description
    in the release notes

*   ``context`` string, which identifies the affected Leap service category as
    follows:

    *   ``api``: SAPI, such as endpoints, HTTP headers, and data structures

    *   ``feature``: Solver features

    *   ``parameter``: Solver parameters

    *   ``solver``: QPU solvers

    *   ``solver type``: Hybrid solvers

*   Link to the release notes, which includes a more detailed description about
    the deprecation

*   Sunset date, which is the date after which the feature is no longer
    guaranteed to be supported
